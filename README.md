Review a total of 20 papers (all journal papers or all conference papers, or a mixture of both journal and conference papers) published in the year 2018 and above and 5 systems/apps in the market. Compare the 5 apps with your proposed system, using a table of comparison of functions. List the proposed functional requirements. Do a SWOT analysis in relation to societal and individual impact.

### Design
Indicate your ACM and Grand Challenges choice and revised proposed functional requirements (if any). Sketch your draft design of the first user interface (similar to index.html) based on the proposed functional requirements. You can use paper-based sketches or Figma or Adobe XD. Develop a skeleton system (a mini version) using Figma or Adobe XD, or Wix. The database part is not compulsory. Do pilot user testing based on relevant standard evaluation metric with a focus group, e.g., heuristic evaluation.

### Develop
Develop the full system/app using any platform you are familiar with.

### Evaluate
Obtain more consolidated user feedback based on the same relevant standard evaluation metric, but with at least 30 users using Google form. Report the above keeping in mind, the evaluation metrics below and usability/UX goals.
